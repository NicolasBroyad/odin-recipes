    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 lb ground beef</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 can (15 oz) tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 can (6 oz) tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 can (14.5 oz) crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried basil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions, drain, and set aside on a large sheet of parchment paper to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>In a large pan, heat a tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and garlic, cooking until softened (about 5 minutes).</li>
        <li>Add the ground beef to the pan and cook until browned, breaking it up with a spoon as it cooks. Drain any excess fat.</li>
        <li>Stir in the tomato sauce, tomato paste, crushed tomatoes, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. Simmer the sauce for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a separate pan, melt the butter over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook for 1-2 minutes to form a roux.</li>
        <li>Slowly add the milk to the roux while whisking to prevent lumps. Cook the mixture, stirring constantly, until it thickens (about 5-7 minutes).</li>
        <li>Remove the béchamel sauce from the heat and stir in the ricotta cheese, 1 cup of mozzarella cheese, and the Parmesan cheese. Add the eggs and chopped parsley, mixing well.</li>
        <li>Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with olive oil. Start layering the lasagna by spreading a small amount of meat sauce on the bottom of the dish.</li>
        <li>Place a layer of lasagna noodles over the meat sauce. Add a layer of the béchamel cheese mixture, followed by more meat sauce. Repeat this process, layering noodles, cheese mixture, and sauce, until all ingredients are used.</li>
    </ol>
